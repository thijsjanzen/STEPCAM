Description: Collection of model estimation, and model plotting functions 
             related to the STEPCAM family of community assembly models. 
             STEPCAM is a STEPwise Community Assembly Model that infers 
             the relative contribution of Dispersal Assembly, Habitat Filtering 
             and Limiting Similarity from a dataset consisting of the 
             combination of trait and abundance data. See also <http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1890/14-0454.1/abstract> for more information.
