Description: Collection of model estimation, and model plotting functions
    related to the STEPCAM family of community assembly models. STEPCAM is
    a STEPwise Community Assembly Model that infers the relative
    contribution of Dispersal Assembly, Habitat Filtering and Limiting
    Similarity from a dataset consisting of the combination of trait and
    abundance data. See also van der Plas et al. 2015
